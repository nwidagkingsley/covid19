# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

In order to identify patterns, evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination, and gain insights through visualizations, this project examines global COVID-19 data.

## Goals

- Clean up and prepare the COVID-19 dataset.  
- Examine monthly and daily patterns in fatalities and new cases.  
- Examine case, death, and vaccination data at the national level.  
- Use scatter plots, bar charts, and line plots to visualize insights.

## Features of the Dataset

- `date`: The record date.  
- `country`: A nation or an area.  
- `new_cases`: Confirmed cases every day.  
- `new_deaths`: Verified deaths every day.  
- `vaccinated`: Total number of vaccinated individuals.

## Visualizations

- **Line Plots**: Monthly trends in cases, fatalities, and vaccinations.  
- **Bar Charts**: Top 10 nations by cases, fatalities, and vaccinations.  
- **Scatter Plots**: The connection between infection rates and vaccination.

## Tools Employed

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib
